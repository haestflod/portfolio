                <h3>3D room decorator</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked on a 3D room decorator with a team where we ported a Unity app to the browser using BabylonJS.
                    I wrote most of the 3D parts in the app.
                    The UI and social aspects were written using CanJS.
                    Most of the UI such as the left side menu is done by team members.
                    The project can be found here: <a href="https://www.egowall.com/">egowall.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The room decorator has 1000+ different furnitures in 4 different LOD levels.
                    The lighting is very simple.
                    There is a light directly above making everything cast a shadow straight down and everything is rendered with phong shading.

                    The video shows some of the very basic manipulation a user can do of a furniture.
                    It has translation, rotation and scaling and later in the video a uesr is adding a furniture from their inventory.
